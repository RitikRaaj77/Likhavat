Through stories, people have passed down knowledge, traditions, and values from one generation to the next. Whether through oral traditions, written literature, or modern media like film and television, storytelling shapes the way we understand the world. It allows us to explore complex emotions, connect with others, and find meaning in everyday life. Stories have the power to inspire, educate, and entertain. They can bridge cultural divides, spark empathy, and ignite the imagination, making storytelling a timeless and universal form of expression.</string>
